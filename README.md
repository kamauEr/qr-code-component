## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learnt

I learnt how to change the flex-direction of components to easily arrange them in a layout.

```css
body {
  min-height: 100vh;
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71175792/how-do-i-center-and-stack-2-items-in-a-flexbox) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to stack 2 items in a flexboz. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
