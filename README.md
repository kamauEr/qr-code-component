### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learnt

I learnt how to change the flex-direction of components to easily arrange them in a layout.

```css
body {
  min-height: 100vh;
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

### Useful resources
